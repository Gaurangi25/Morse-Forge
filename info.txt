🔍 -webkit-background-clip: text;
Tells the browser: “Apply the background (your gradient) only inside the text's shape, not behind it.”

Without this, the gradient sits behind the text, not inside it.

🔍 -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;
Makes the actual color of the text invisible so that the background (gradient) can show through the text.

If you don’t do this, your text color (like white or black) will block the gradient.
